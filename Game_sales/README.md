## General Conclusion

This work was devoted to a study of the sales of 11,559 games released on 31 gaming platforms on three continents, from 1980 to 2016. Most of the data was collected from 1993.

Among the conclusions **about the platforms**, the main ones can be noted:

    1. Top five by total sum of sales: 'PS2', 'X360', 'PS3', 'Wii', 'DS'
    2. Wii, X360, DS the biggest since 2004
    3. 'NES', 'SNES', 'GB', '2600', 'GEN' used to be popular before 2001. It seems the release of PS pushed all other platforms out of the market in 1994.
    4. Median life expectancy: 12.0 years
    5. Computer games could be popular but could not break the top.
    6. The '3DS', 'WiiU' platforms seem promising. They arose relatively recently - 2011 and 2012, respectively. Even though, sales declined, they can still grow, since the life cycle has not yet been exhausted.
    7. Sales are significantly different from each other. There are platforms that stand out from the rest. For example, the PS platform line, the DS platform, Wii and 360.
    8. PC platform has higher user score then Xbox One

A slight positive average correlation (0.39) was found between critics' ratings and sales of games for top platforms.

**Regarding genres**, it was revealed that

    • most popular and profitable genres: 'Action', 'Sports', 'Misc'
    • the unpopular and least profitable: 'Fighting', 'Strategy', 'Puzzle'
    • action games have higher user score than sports

Speaking of **regional specifics**, then:

    • Japan paly in DS and PS2. People buy Role-Play and Platform games. Games for everyone are popular in Japan, and T, M, and E10 + are equally less popular.
