# Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting
__[pandas, matplotlib, nltkm, scipy]__

The goal of this project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. I had to find out if a customer’s statuses have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. I used bank data on customers’ creditworthiness. 

## Conclusions

Has been analyzed large amount of data consists information about clients who have some relations with bank debt. The data provided had some errors and inaccuracies which required to deal with them. I made data suitable for analysis by applying several functions. 

Here some preliminary results. Can be primarily designated further hypothesis according to the chances to repay a loan:

1. existence of the children decries chances to repay a loan
2. (marriage/divorced/widow(er)) status is increase chances to repay a loan;
3. rich and middle class repay loans better the poor and lower-middle class;
4. loan for auto and education repaying worse, than loans for wedding, commers or real estate costs;
5. the educated clients the better chance to repay loan;
6. clients with experience more than 25 years has more chances to repay loan. The lowest chances have clients with experience from 2 to 5 years. 
7. retired, servants and business are better loan payers than employees.

Import to remember that results don’t show causation only some correlation between variables. For discovered deeper results, with structural relations and causations among data, more serious statistical analysis required.
