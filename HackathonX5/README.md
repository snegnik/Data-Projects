**Tools kit**: [Clusterization, PSA, Scaled, t-SNE] <br>
**Libraries**: [pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn]

## Description
The hackathon was organized by the X5 group, which combines Pyaterochka, Lenta and Karusel - retail grocery stores. They have a lot of data on customer purchases. And there is a desire to get new ideas on how to use them. link: [X5 DataMonetize](https://datamonetize.ru/)

## Problem
Our team needed to figure out how to use the purchase receipt data.

## Ð¡onclusions
Based on the received data, our team developed a hypothesis that customers can be segmented by their food basket. We wanted to predict the purchase of goods before the customer buys them. The results did not confirm our hypothesis that buyers are segmented in this way. It is possible to obtain segments at certain slices. But the power of the computer does not allow for multiple experiments.
