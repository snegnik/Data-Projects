Based on the received data, our team developed a hypothesis that customers can be segmented by their food basket. The result should have looked like a plane with dots on it. Each point is a customer. And the distance between the points is the coefficient of coincidence of the basket of one user with another. To solve this problem, a customer-product matrix was built. Two methods for reducing the dimension of PSA and TSNE are applied to the matrix. The results did not confirm our hypothesis that buyers are segmented in this way. It is possible to obtain segments at certain slices. But the power of the computer does not allow for multiple experiments.
