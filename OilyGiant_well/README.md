# Finding the best place for a new OilyGiant well
**Tools kit**: [Bootstrap, Linear Regression, MSE, Profit, Quantile] <br>
**Libraries**: [pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib]

## Description
The data were given of oil production volumes by wells in three regions. Based on these data, I built a model - linear regression - and applied the bootstrap method to identify the most profitable region.

## Problem
To find the most profitable regions in terms of profit for drilling oil wells.

## Ð¡onclusions
All three regions are suitable for development. Of the three, Region 1 looks the most interesting. Region 1 could bring the most profit with hight probability and its development carries the least risks. Region 2 follows Region 1. Region 1 data is not normally distributed.
